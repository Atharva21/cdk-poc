# A AWS CDK startup template.

A specially crafted AWS CDK template that is designed as a reference for a fully serverless application <br>
Simple, clean, and easy to get started with your custom requirements.

## Is it for you?
- Designed for beginners to quickly get started with AWS CDK.

## Architecture: 


## Deploy:
-   `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile

-   `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
-   `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
-   `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
-   `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region

## Test lambda -> TODO:
